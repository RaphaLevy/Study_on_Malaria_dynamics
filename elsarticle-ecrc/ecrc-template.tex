This work employs a modified SIR/SEI methodology, based on work from Parham and Michael (2010) which takes into account rainfall and temperature, with further modifications to avoid delay equations. Primary results show that the model is too sensible on some parameters, and using values indicated by other papers did not give the same results, opening up future work to compare the modified model equations with the originals. With the obtained results, it was possible to verify a strong effect caused by increased contact of host and vectors on the transmission of the disease.

\section{Introduction}
\label{}
The Amazon is one of the largest and most biodiverse tropical forests 
in the world, harboring numerous species of plants, animals, and 
microorganisms, including vectors and pathogens responsible for the 
transmission of various diseases. Among them, one of the most common 
is malaria, caused by protozoa of the genus \textit{Plasmodium}, 
transmitted by the bite of the infected female mosquito of the genus 
\textit{Anopheles}. It is present in 22 American countries, but the 
areas with the highest risk of infection are located in the Amazon 
region, encompassing nine countries, which accounted for $68\%$ of 
infection cases in 
2011 \cite{pimenta_orfano_bahia_duarte_rios-velasquez_melo_pessoa_oliveira_campos_villegas_etal_2015}. 
Although malaria is prevalent in the Americas, it is 
not limited to this continent and is found in countries in Africa and Asia, 
resulting in more than two million cases of infection and 445,000 deaths 
worldwide in 2016 \cite{regulation_of_sexual_commitment}.

Notably, vector-borne disease transmission is closely related to 
environmental changes that interfere with the ecosystem of both 
transmitting organisms and affected organisms. In the case of the 
Amazon, agricultural and livestock settlements are among the factors
that most favor disease transmission, both due to the deforestation 
they cause for establishment and the clustering of people in environments 
close to the vector's habitat \cite{silva-nunes_malaria_amazon_2008}, 
especially by clustering non-immune migrants near these natural and 
artificial breeding sites \cite{DASILVANUNES2012281}.

Additionally, other factors such as rainfall, wildfires, and mining 
also significantly influence disease transmission in the region. These 
events result in habitat loss, ecosystem fragmentation, and climate 
changes, affecting the distribution and abundance of vectors and hosts, 
as well as their interaction with pathogens. Furthermore, population growth 
and urbanization also play a crucial role in disease spread, increasing 
human exposure to vectors and infection risks.

In this context, this work aims to investigate vector-borne disease 
transmission in the Amazon and analyze how environmental impacts 
influence the dynamics of malaria transmission, the ecological and 
socioeconomic factors affecting this spread, and possible prevention 
and control strategies. The main reference for this research is the 
Trajetórias Project, developed by the Center for Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (SinBiose/CNPq), which is a dataset including 
environmental, epidemiological, economic, and socioeconomic indicators 
for all municipalities in the Legal Amazon, analyzing the spatial and 
temporal relationship between economic trajectories linked to the dynamics 
of agrarian systems, whether they are family-based rural or large-scale 
agricultural and livestock production, the availability of natural resources, 
and the risk of diseases \cite{Rorato2023}.

\section{Model formulation}
\label{}
Based on previous work developed to model the transmission of malaria based on precipitation and temperature dynamics \cite{Parham2010}, we focus on two different sets of compartments: susceptible hosts ($S_H$), infected hosts ($I_H$), recovered hosts ($R_H$), susceptible vectors ($S_M$), exposed vectors ($E_M$) and infected vectors ($I_M$). The equations that describe the transmission are given as:
%\begin{gather}
\begin{align}
\dfrac{dS_H}{dt} & = -ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H \label{eq1}\\
\dfrac{dI_H}{dt} & = ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H - \gamma I_H \label{eq2}\\
\dfrac{dR_H}{dt} & = \gamma I_H \label{eq3}\\
\dfrac{dS_M}{dt} & = b - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu S_M \label{eq4}\\
\dfrac{dE_M}{dt} & = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu E_M - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) \label{eq5}\\
\dfrac{dI_M}{dt} & = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) - \mu I_M \label{eq6}
\end{align}
%\end{gather}

The parameters are given in Table 1, while the variables are given in Table 2, which can be found in the Appendix. The selected human population was from the the rural area of Manaus, between the years of 2004 to 2008, as this locality had the highest incidence of malaria caused by $P. \ vivax$ in the Amazon region \cite{Rorato2023}. This species of $\text{Plasmodium}$ was chosen as it is responsible for the highest number of malaria cases in Brazil \cite{OliveiraFerreira2010, 10.3389/fpubh.2021.647754}. With the incidence function \cite{Rorato2023} we have that

\begin{align}
\text{Inc}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2) = \dfrac{\text{Cases}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2)}{\text{Pop}(m,z,(t_1+t_2)/2) \times 5 \ \text{years}} \times 10^5,
\end{align}

where $\text{Cases}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2)$ is the number of cases of disease $d$ in zone $z$ of municipality 
$m$, and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the initial and final years of the interval, while 
$\text{Pop}(m,z,(t_1+t_2)/2) \times 5 \ \text{years}$ is the population in zone $z$ 
of municipality $m$ in the middle of the period multiplied by the total number 
of observation years. In this case, we could indicate as:

\begin{align}
    \footnotesize{\text{Inc}(\text{Vivax}, \text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2004, 2008) = \dfrac{\text{Cases}(\text{Vivax}, \text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2004, 2008)}{\text{Pop}(\text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2006) \times 5 \ \text{years}} \times 10^5}  \\
    184030.8 = \dfrac{78745}{5\text{Pop}} \times 10^5 \Rightarrow Pop \approx 8558
\end{align}

Using data on the total population of Manaus in this period, 
with an incidence of 3106.429047 and a number of cases of 262264, the 
total population of the municipality was estimated to be 1688524 
inhabitants, which corresponds to the value found in the official census \cite{Datasus2006}. Thus, the rural population could be considered as 
approximately 0.5$\%$ of the municipality's population.

Having estimated the percentage size of the rural population 
in the city, it was possible to calculate this population for 
each of the years of the analysis through linear interpolation 
using historical series data from IBGE \cite{popIBGE}:

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Manaus' rural population from 2004 to 2009.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c | c|}
 \hline
 \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Estimated rural population}\\ 
 \hline
$2004$ & $7717$ \\
 \hline
 $2005$ & $7889$ \\
 \hline
 $2006$ & $8061$ \\
 \hline
 $2007$ & $8233$ \\
 \hline
 $2008$ & $8492$ \\
 \hline
 $2009$ & $8751$ \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As there were population data for the years 2000, 2007, and 2010, 
interpolations were performed with different initial and final 
points, using data from 2000 to 2007 for 2004-2007 and from 2007 
to 2010 for 2008-2009, ensuring the correct use of the 2007 population.
