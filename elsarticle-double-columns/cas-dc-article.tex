This paper aims to analyze the behavior of malaria transmission in the Amazon region based on climatic and environmental changes, such as temperature, precipitation and deforestation, through proposed modifications to the SIR and SEI models, in order to contribute to the study of applications of external effects on the evolution of the disease. 
The Trajetórias Project, developed by the Synthesis Center 
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (SinBiose/CNPq) was used as an initial reference for the study. This work employs a modified SIR/SEI methodology, based on work from Parham and Michael (2010) which takes into account rainfall and temperature, with further modifications to avoid delay equations. Primary results show that the model is too sensible on some parameters, and using values indicated by other papers did not give the same results, opening up future work to compare the modified model equations with the originals. With the obtained results, it was possible to verify a strong effect caused by increased contact of host and vectors on the transmission of the disease.

\section{Introduction}

The Amazon is one of the largest and most biodiverse tropical forests 
in the world, harboring numerous species of plants, animals, and 
microorganisms, including vectors and pathogens responsible for the 
transmission of various diseases. Among them, one of the most common 
is malaria, caused by protozoa of the genus \textit{Plasmodium}, 
transmitted by the bite of the infected female mosquito of the genus 
\textit{Anopheles}. It is present in 22 American countries, but the 
areas with the highest risk of infection are located in the Amazon 
region, encompassing nine countries, which accounted for $68\%$ of 
infection cases in 
2011 \cite{pimenta_orfano_bahia_duarte_rios-velasquez_melo_pessoa_oliveira_campos_villegas_etal_2015}. 
Although malaria is prevalent in the Americas, it is 
not limited to this continent and is found in countries in Africa and Asia, 
resulting in more than two million cases of infection and 445,000 deaths 
worldwide in 2016 \cite{regulation_of_sexual_commitment}, being endemic in a total of 84 countries in 2021 \cite{WHO2022}.

Notably, vector-borne disease transmission is closely related to 
environmental changes that interfere with the ecosystem of both 
transmitting organisms and affected organisms. In the case of the 
Amazon, agricultural and livestock settlements are among the factors
that most favor disease transmission, both due to the deforestation 
they cause for establishment and the clustering of people in environments 
close to the vector's habitat \cite{silva-nunes_malaria_amazon_2008}, 
especially by clustering non-immune migrants near these natural and 
artificial breeding sites \cite{DASILVANUNES2012281}.

Additionally, other factors such as rainfall, wildfires, and mining 
also significantly influence disease transmission in the region. These 
events result in habitat loss, ecosystem fragmentation, and climate 
changes, affecting the distribution and abundance of vectors and hosts, 
as well as their interaction with pathogens. Furthermore, population growth 
and urbanization also play a crucial role in disease spread, increasing 
human exposure to vectors and infection risks.

In this context, this work aims to investigate vector-borne disease 
transmission in the Amazon and analyze how environmental impacts 
influence the dynamics of malaria transmission, the ecological and 
socioeconomic factors affecting this spread, and possible prevention 
and control strategies. The main reference for this research is the 
Trajetórias Project, developed by the Center for Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (SinBiose/CNPq), which is a dataset including 
environmental, epidemiological, economic, and socioeconomic indicators 
for all municipalities in the Legal Amazon, analyzing the spatial and 
temporal relationship between economic trajectories linked to the dynamics 
of agrarian systems, whether they are family-based rural or large-scale 
agricultural and livestock production, the availability of natural resources, 
and the risk of diseases \cite{Rorato2023}.

\section{Model formulation}

Based on previous work developed to model the transmission of malaria based on precipitation and temperature dynamics \cite{Parham2010}, we focus 
on two different sets of compartments: susceptible hosts ($S_H$), infected hosts ($I_H$), recovered hosts ($R_H$), susceptible vectors ($S_M$), 
exposed vectors ($E_M$) and infected vectors ($I_M$). The equations that describe the transmission are initially given as:
%\begin{gather}
\begin{align}
\dfrac{dS_H}{dt} & = -ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H \label{eq1}\\
\dfrac{dI_H}{dt} & = ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H - \gamma I_H \label{eq2}\\
\dfrac{dR_H}{dt} & = \gamma I_H \label{eq3}\\
\dfrac{dS_M}{dt} & = b - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu S_M \label{eq4}\\
\dfrac{dE_M}{dt} & = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu E_M - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) \label{eq5}\\
\dfrac{dI_M}{dt} & = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) - \mu I_M \label{eq6}
\end{align}
%\end{gather}

However, the use of these equations proved to be unsuccessful for the modelling of the mosquito populations through the SEI equations, 
causing $(5)$ to be very close to 0, and therefore mirroring the oscillations of $S$ and $I$, a behavior not seen in nature. 

To overcome this effect, the SEI equations were modified in order for $b_1$ to only be used in the transference between compartments $S$ and $E$, 
and a new parameter, $b_3$ to move mosquitos from $E$ to $I$. Being inversely related to the incubation period, the definition of this rate can be found in \textbf{Table A.2}. 
In addition to that, the parameter $a(T)$ that was in use in the transition between exposed and infected also had to be removed, as no further bites occur at this point. 
The parameter $l$ also had to be disassociated from the infection rate of exposed individual ($b_3$).

The SIR equations were also modified, to take into consideration population dynamics, including a $\mu_H$ parameter as both a birth and mortality rate.

The finalized equations used in the model are as following:  

\begin{align}
\dfrac{dS_H}{dt} & = \mu_HN-ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H - \mu_HS_H \label{eq1}\\ %\dfrac{dS_H}{dt} & = -ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H \label{eq1}\\
\dfrac{dI_H}{dt} & = ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H-\gamma I_H - \mu_HI_H \label{eq2}\\ %\dfrac{dI_H}{dt} & = ab_2\bigg(\dfrac{I_M}{N}\bigg)S_H - \gamma I_H \label{eq2}\\
\dfrac{dR_H}{dt} & = \gamma I_H - \mu_HR_H \label{eq3}\\ %\dfrac{dR_H}{dt} & = \gamma I_H \label{eq3}\\
\dfrac{dS_M}{dt} & = b - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu S_M \label{eq4}\\ %b - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu S_M \label{eq4}\\
\dfrac{dE_M}{dt} & = ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu E_M - b_3E_M -lE_M \label{eq5} \\%ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_M - \mu E_M - ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) \label{eq5}\\
\dfrac{dI_M}{dt} & = b_3E_M -\mu I_M  \label{eq6} %ab_1\bigg(\dfrac{I_H}{N}\bigg)S_Ml(\tau_M) - \mu I_M \label{eq6}
\end{align}

The parameters are given in Table A1, while the variables are given in Table A2, which can be found in the Appendix. 
The selected human population was from the the rural area of Manaus, between the years of 2004 to 2008, as this locality had the highest incidence of malaria 
caused by $P. \ vivax$ in the Amazon region \cite{Rorato2023}. This species of $\text{Plasmodium}$ was chosen as it is responsible for the highest number of malaria
 cases in Brazil \cite{OliveiraFerreira2010, 10.3389/fpubh.2021.647754}, being the most common human malaria 
parasite in the region \cite{Vector_Incrimination}. With the incidence function \cite{Rorato2023} we have that

\begin{align}
\text{Inc} = %(d, m, z, t_1, t_2) = 
\dfrac{\text{Cases}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2)}{\text{Pop}(m,z,(t_1+t_2)/2) \times 5 \ \text{years}} \times 10^5,
\end{align}

where $\text{Cases}(d, m, z, t_1, t_2)$ is the number of cases of disease $d$ in zone $z$ of municipality 
$m$, and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the initial and final years of the interval, while 
$\text{Pop}(m,z,(t_1+t_2)/2) \times 5 \ \text{years}$ is the population in zone $z$ 
of municipality $m$ in the middle of the period multiplied by the total number 
of observation years. In this case, we could indicate as:

\begin{align}
    \footnotesize{\text{Inc}(\text{Vivax}, \text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2004, 2008) = } \\
= \footnotesize{\dfrac{\text{Cases}(\text{Vivax}, \text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2004, 2008)}{\text{Pop}(\text{Manaus}, \text{Rural}, 2006) \times 5 \ \text{years}} \times 10^5} \Rightarrow  \\
    \Rightarrow 184030.8 = \dfrac{78745}{5\text{Pop}} \times 10^5 \Rightarrow Pop \approx 8558
\end{align}

Using data on the total population of Manaus in this period, 
with an incidence of 3106.429047 and a number of cases of 262264, the 
total population of the municipality was estimated to be 1688524 
inhabitants, which corresponds to the value found in the official census \cite{Datasus2006}. Thus, the rural population could be considered as 
approximately 0.5$\%$ of the municipality's population.

Having estimated the percentage size of the rural population 
in the city, it was possible to calculate this population for 
each of the years of the analysis through linear interpolation 
using historical series data from IBGE \cite{popIBGE}:

Given there was only population data for the years of 2000, 2007, and 2010, 
interpolations were performed with different initial and final 
points, using data from 2000 to 2007 for 2004-2007 and from 2007 
to 2010 for 2008-2009, ensuring the correct use of the 2007 population. 
Given the population growth between 2004 and 2009, the annual birth rate was 
estimated to be 206.8 births per year. Therefore, this corresponds 
to approximately 0.56657 births per day and 0.00007 births per day 
per person, which would be our $\mu_H$. 

Temperature and precipitation data were taken from the Mosqlimate Data API datastore \cite{MosqlimateAPI}, from January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2008, with the geocode 1302603.

As for the theory behind environmental factors, it is known that the removal of tree canopies allowed 
the resurgence of malaria in South America \cite{Norris2004}. In deforested areas, 
without tree canopies covering the ground, water puddles under sunlight 
attract mosquitoes of the species $Anopheles \ darlingi$, the main vector 
related to human malaria in the Amazon \cite{infoAnopheles}. They are 
usually less commonly found in still intact forests. This is 
because light and heat favor the development of larvae and 
pupae, in addition to a greater availability of algae for 
larval feeding \cite{article_alteracoesambientais}. The increase 
in ambient temperature also favors the vectorial capacity of 
mosquitoes. 

Deforestation also attracts and brings humans closer 
to take part in logging, agriculture, and road construction 
activities, bringing individuals infected with $Plasmodium$ to 
an area where both the vector and the environment have already 
been modified to favor transmission. Furthermore, agriculture 
also promotes river sedimentation, providing suitable environments 
for breeding sites. Therefore, it can be considered a relevant 
change for the model to take into account deforestation, the 
increase in survival probabilities of eggs, larvae, and pupae, 
as well as increasing the proportion of bites that lead to infection, 
due to the increased human population density in areas near mosquito 
breeding sites.

As it was outside the scope of this project to collect samples of $A. \ darlingi \ in \ loco$, it was instead used 
an estimate for the number of mosquitos based in the literature. As the study was made around the rural population of the municipality,
this would favour the clustering of adult mosquitos, given the proximity to bodies of water and recently open up areas of rainforest \cite{Biological_Variation_Anopheles}. 
In fact, the municipality of Manaus has a great number of breeding sites in its' periurban and rural areas, both natural and man-made. Many of the city's fish farming tanks 
have been noted as breeding sites for $A. \ darlingi$ \cite{Abundancia_Larval}.

\section{Mathematical analysis of the model}

\subsection{Basic Reproduction Number ($\mathcal{R}_0$)}
To derive the $\mathcal{R}_0$ of the model, $X_s$ is defined as the set of all disease-free states, 
$$X_s=\{x \geq 0|x_i=0, i=1,\ldots,m\},$$
where $X=(x_1,\ldots, x_n)^T$, such that $x_i\geq 0$ represents the number 
of individuals in each compartment, and each function is assumed to be 
continuously differentiable at least twice in each variable ($C^2$) \cite{Rep_Number_Comp_Model}.

Rearranging the equations so that the first $m$ equations 
contain the infected individuals, let ${\mathcal F}_i(x)$ be the 
rate of appearance of new infections in compartment $i$, 
${\mathcal V}_i^+(x)$ be the rate of individuals entering 
compartment $i$ by other means, and ${\mathcal V}_i^-(x)$ 
be the rate of individuals leaving compartment $i$. The disease 
transmission model consists of non-negative initial conditions 
together with the following system of equations:
$$\dot{x}=f_i(x)={\mathcal F}_i(x)-{\mathcal V}_i(x), i=1,\ldots, n,$$
where ${\mathcal V}_i (x) = {\mathcal V}_i^{-}(x) - {\mathcal V}_i^+(x)$. 
Here, 
$F=\left[\frac{\partial {\mathcal F}_i (x_0)}{\partial x_j}\right]$ 
and $V=\left[\frac{\partial {\mathcal V}_i (x_0) }{\partial x_j}\right]$, 
where $x_0$ is a Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), and $1\leq i,j \leq m$, and $\mathcal{R}_0 = \rho(FV^{-1})$.
